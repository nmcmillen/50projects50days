            <p>"Video games will get you nowhere‚Äù is something I heard as a child, but that didn't stop me from
                competing in a video game competition that would lead me to traveling the world working in the
                motorsports industry as a professional racecar driver, coach, and brand ambassador.

                A self-starter and quick learner who enjoys a fast paced environment and pushing the boundaries of what
                is possible. Diverse background with experience in a little bit of everything from professional media
                training and communications to marketing and project management.

                After starting my own web-based company, I found a joy for building and developing which led me to
                becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer where I can create, learn, and progress every day.
